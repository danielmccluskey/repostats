# Introduction
***This mod is still in development, you can use the mod now and your stats will be collected, but they may not be available on the website until I develop that part properly.***

A Mod for the game R.E.P.O. that collects and displays your post-run stats at https://repo.splitstats.io

I plan to include the following stats and more:
- Run summaries
- Death counts
- Highest Levels completed leaderboard
- Haul History
- More!

***Using this mod now helps me gather more data which is a huge help when developing the web side of the mod.***
